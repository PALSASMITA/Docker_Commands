Cointainer Orchestration
Applications are typically made up of individually containerized components( called microservices)
that must be organized at the networking level inorder for the application to run as intended. T he process of organizing multiple containers in this manner is known as container orchestration

Docker Swarm is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers. With Swarm, IT administrators and developers can establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system.
 CREATING A DOCKER SWARM CLUSTER
ON The Master Master
docker swarm init --advertise-addr=<ip-address-of leader/master
On THE DOCKER NODE
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo docker swarm join --token  <from the master get the joining token>
ON THE MASTER 
docker node ls <to check connected node/s>
