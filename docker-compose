Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
With Compose, use a YAML file to configure your application's service. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. Run docker-compose up and compose starts and runs your entire app.
sy - sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /user/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /user/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version
 1. Create a folder called "docker"
2. Write the sample YAML file in "docker-compose.yml"file
3. Docker-compose file syntax
   docker-compose up -d

nano docker-compose.yml
      
version: '3'
  services:
    sample1:
	  image: httpd
	  ports:
	    -"80:80"
		
	sample2:
      image: 'nginx'

docker-compose up -d - run docker files
docker ps
docker-compose down  - removes/deletes docker files
